  title: Exchangeable Random Measures for Sparse and Modular Graphs with Overlapping
    Communities
  journal: 'Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology)'
  year: '2020'

  abstract: We propose a novel statistical model for sparse networks with overlapping
    community structure. The model is based on representing the graph as an exchangeable
    point process and naturally generalizes existing probabilistic models with overlapping
    block structure to the sparse regime. Our construction builds on vectors of completely
    random measures and has interpretable parameters, each node being assigned a vector
    representing its levels of affiliation to some latent communities. We develop
    methods for efficient simulation of this class of random graphs and for scalable
    posterior inference. We show that the approach proposed can recover interpretable
    structure of real world networks and can handle graphs with thousands of nodes
    and tens of thousands of edges.

  title: Approche bayésienne hiérarchique et dynamique pour la prédiction et l’agrégation

  abstract: Scorelab has developed the Global Wine Score, a score aggregator used
    to evaluate and compare all the wines in the world. It is based on the ratings
    of critics who are recognized in the world of wine. However, not all wines are
    rated by a sufficient number of critics to be able to provide a minimal degree
    of confidence. We develop a Bayesian approach to enrich the score with a prediction
    that borrows information from earlier vintages and neighboring appellations. We
    exploit the geographical hierarchy of appellations through a hierarchical Bayesian
    model. Residual ratings over the years are modeled by a multi-sensor Kalman filter.

  title: Probabilistic and Bayesian nonparametric approaches for recommenders systems
    and networks
  school: University of Bordeaux
  year: '2016'
  type: phdthesis
  month: Nov
  abstract: We propose two novel approaches for recommender systems and networks.
    In the first part, we first give an overview of recommender systems and concentrate
    on the low-rank approaches for matrix completion. Building on a probabilistic
    approach, we propose novel penalty functions on the singular values of the low-rank
    matrix. By exploiting a mixture model representation of this penalty, we show
    that a suitably chosen set of latent variables enables to derive an expectation-maximization
    algorithm to obtain a maximum a posteriori estimate of the completed low-rank
    matrix. The resulting algorithm is an iterative soft-thresholded algorithm which
    iteratively adapts the shrinkage coefficients associated to the singular values.
    The algorithm is simple to implement and can scale to large matrices. We provide
    numerical comparisons between our approach and recent alternatives showing the
    interest of the proposed approach for low-rank matrix completion. In the second
    part, we first introduce some background on Bayesian nonparametrics and in particular
    on completely random measures (CRMs) and their multivariate extension, the compound
    CRMs. We then propose a novel statistical model for sparse networks with overlapping
    community structure. The model is based on representing the graph as an exchangeable
    point process, and naturally generalizes existing probabilistic models with overlapping
    block-structure to the sparse regime. Our construction builds on vectors of CRMs,
    and has interpretable parameters, each node being assigned a vector representing
    its level of affiliation to some latent communities. We develop methods for simulating
    this class of random graphs, as well as to perform posterior inference. We show
    that the proposed approach can recover interpretable structure from two real-world
    networks and can handle graphs with thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of
    edges.

  abstract: We introduce a low-rank Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) model for bipartite
    graphs. Recently, Caron (2012) proposed a BNP model where each node is given its
    own sociability parameter allowing to capture the power-law behavior of real world
    bipartite graphs. This model can be considered as a rank one nonnegative factorization
    of the adjacency matrix. Building on the compound random measures recently introduced
    by Griffin and Leisen (2014), we derive a rank $p$ generalization of this model
    where each node is associated with a $p$-dimensional vector of sociability parameters
    accounting for several latent dimensions. While preserving the desired properties
    of interpretability, scalability and power-law behavior, our model is more flexible
    and provides better predictive performance as illustrated on several datasets.

  abstract: In machine learning, empirical performance on real data are crucial in
    the success of a method. Recent years have seen the emergence of a large number
    of machine learning competitions. These challenges are motivated by industrial
    (Netflix prize) or academic (HiggsML challenge) applications and put in competition
    researchers and data scientists to obtain the best performance. We wanted to expose
    students to this reality by submitting a challenge in the context of the machine
    learning course. The leaderboard is displayed on an automatically updated web
    page allowing emulation among students. The history of the results also allows
    them to visualize their progress through the submissions. In addition, the challenge
    can continue outside of the supervised sessions promoting in-dependence and exploration
    of new learning techniques and computer tools. The system we have implemented
    is available as an R package for reuse by other teachers. Building on the R Markdown
    and Dropbox tools, it requires no network configuration and can be deployed very
    easily on a personal computer.

  title: 'Biips: Software for Bayesian Inference with Interacting Particle Systems'
  month: Dec
  year: '2014'
  abstract: Biips is a software platform for automatic Bayesian inference with interacting
    particle systems. Biips allows users to define their statistical model in the
    probabilistic programming BUGS language, as well as to add custom functions or
    samplers within this language. Then it runs sequential Monte Carlo based algorithms
    (particle filters, particle independent Metropolis-Hastings, particle marginal
    Metropolis-Hastings) in a black-box manner so that to approximate the posterior
    distribution of interest as well as the marginal likelihood. The software is developed
    in C++ with interfaces with the softwares R, Matlab and Octave.

  abstract: We consider the problem of local radioelectric property estimation from
    global electromagnetic scattering measurements. This challenging ill-posed high
    dimensional inverse problem can be explored by intensive computations of a parallel
    Maxwell solver on a petaflopic supercomputer. Then, it is shown how Bayesian inference
    can be perfomed with a Particle Marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) approach,
    which includes a Rao-Blackwellised Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm with interacting
    Kalman filters. Material properties, including a multiple components "Debye relaxation"/"Lorenzian
    resonant" material model, are estimated; it is illustrated on synthetic data.
    Eventually, we propose different ways to deal with higher dimensional problems,
    from parallelization to the original introduction of efficient sequential data
    assimilation techniques, widely used in weather forecasting, oceanography, geophysics,
    etc.

    aux valeurs singulières.
