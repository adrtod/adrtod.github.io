**H**ierarchical **A**daptive **S**oft **I**mpute (HASI) is an algorithm for low-rank matrix completion using an adaptive spectral regularization based on a hierarchical prior over the singular values of the unknown matrix.

The main application is in Collaborative Filtering where the unknown matrix represents user preferences for items.

The software is distributed as a Matlab package.

It makes use of the PROPACK algorithm for handling large scale matrices.
